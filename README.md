Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workshop materials

Welcome to the Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workshop! We will spend a couple hours together
learning about TDD and applying it to simple Python programs.

This course assumes basic knowledge of programming in Python, but not much else!

# Environment Setup
## System Requirements
Some prerequisites for your system:
*   Python 3 (samples in course use Python 3.6)
*   IDE of your choosing (e.g., VS Code, Sublime, Atom)
*   Terminal environment (e.g., system, IDE-integrated)

## Pre-Workshop Setup
-   Download this repository to your local system. Here are a couple ways you can do that:

    Using git:

        git clone https://github.com/supernaut11/tdd-workshop.git

    Using curl:

        curl -LO https://github.com/supernaut11/tdd-workshop/archive/master.zip
        unzip master.zip

    Using a web browser:

        https://github.com/supernaut11/tdd-workshop/archive/master.zip

-   Run the initialization script

        ./init.sh

    Note that python3 must be defined for the script to work
